\maketitle

Following are the design choices that I've made:-

\begin{itemize}
    \item I have added a new Error named \textbf{ERROR 104 Username taken} which 
    is thrown by the server when any client tries to register by an username that is 
    already present in the chat.

    \item For the case when sender->server messeage doesn't have Error 103 but reciever throws 
    this error to server then I do not close the connection between reciever and server.

    \item By default maximum of 10 clients are allowed (can be changed by providing a command line 
    argument while running the server).

    \item These are for the cases which are not mentioned in the assignment statement, rest all the things 
    I have strictly followed the formats and guidelines provided.
\end{itemize}
