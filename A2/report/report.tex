\maketitle

Following are the design choices that I've made:-

\begin{itemize}
    \item I have added a new Error named \textbf{ERROR 104 Username taken} which 
    is thrown by the server when any client tries to register by an username that is 
    already present in the chat.

    \item For the case when sender-$>$server messeage doesn't have Error 103 but reciever throws 
    this error to server then I do not close the connection between reciever and server.

    \item By default maximum of 100 clients are allowed to make connection to the server (you can change
    this by providing max connaction as command line argument while running the server)

    \item I've given the flexibility to either provide the serverIP and serverPort thourgh command line
    argument while running the client, but if not provided by default local host IP and port number 9999
    will be taken.

    \item These are for the cases which are not mentioned in the assignment statement, rest all the things 
    I have strictly followed the formats and guidelines provided.
\end{itemize}
